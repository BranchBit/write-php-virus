+ Here the virus will infect example.php.
+ If you run example.php it will infect any other file next to it
+ the new file will get different payload, because it encrypted using different key,
  this is good becuase virus not always has same encrypted base64 string.
- it will also infect itslef, then if you run it again execute will be defined twice
  and the code will break. 
  see next step
